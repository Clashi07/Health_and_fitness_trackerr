Assembly-project cse-341

Briefly explain what will do on the Health and Fitness Tracker projects

✅ 1. Weekly Progress Comparison
What You Can Do:
Store 7 values in an array (e.g., steps, calories burned per day).


Compare this week's values with last week's (stored in another array).


Display increase/decrease with basic output.


Assembly Tools Used: Arrays, loops, comparison, conditional branching.

✅ 2. Goal-Completion Reminder
What You Can Do:
Let user input their goal (e.g., 5000 steps).


Continuously compare daily steps with goal using conditional checks.


Show a reminder message if the goal is not yet reached.


Assembly Tools Used: User input/output, comparisons, branching.

✅ 3. Calories Burned Per Exercise Type
What You Can Do:
Use a menu: e.g., 1 = Running, 2 = Walking, 3 = Jumping.


Store predefined calorie burn rates.


Ask for duration and calculate burned calories (rate × time).
Assembly Tools Used: Arrays, multiplication, input, branching.

✅ 4. Body Fat Percentage Estimator
What You Can Do:
Input weight and waist size.


Use a simplified formula like the U.S. Navy method.


Output estimated body fat percentage.


Assembly Tools Used: Basic arithmetic, macros, stack (for intermediate values).

✅ 5. Time-to-Goal Estimator
What You Can Do:
Ask for goal (e.g., weight loss target or calorie burn).


Take daily average progress and divide to estimate time left.


Display output as days/weeks.


Assembly Tools Used: Division, loops, input/output.

✅ 6. Automatic Calorie Intake Suggestion
What You Can Do:
Ask for weight, age, and activity level.


Use a simplified calorie estimation formula (e.g., BMR × activity factor).


Display the suggested daily intake.


Assembly Tools Used: Arrays (for factors), arithmetic, branching.

✅ 7. Hydration Reminder & Tracker
What You Can Do:
Take input of daily water intake (in glasses).


If below threshold (e.g., 8), remind the user.


Track total over a week with array storage.


Assembly Tools Used: Arrays, loops, comparisons.

✅ 8. Sleep Duration Tracker & Analysis
What You Can Do:
Take sleep hours per day for 7 days.


Store in array, calculate average.


Give simple analysis: “Too little”, “Optimal”, or “Too much”.


Assembly Tools Used: Arrays, average calculation, conditional branching.
